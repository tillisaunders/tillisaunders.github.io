## About Me ✨
<br>
Hi, I'm Tilli 👋 I'm a Level Designer working in **London**!
At the moment I am working in the Mobile F2P space, but I am looking for my next big adventure in the industry!
<br>
I love games, and have a strong fondness for RPG games *(big fan of Fallout, Elder Scrolls and Baldur's Gate!!)*
<br>
In my free time I also love to read, my favourite genres are *Horror/Thriller*, *Fantasy*, and *Sci-Fi*!
<br>
I have two cats and a cornsnake, I'm a big animal person and **love** decorating my space with cat themed decor!! 🐈‍⬛
<br>
<br>
I love connections and socialising with people, I believe that a strong team is a team that gets along even outside of work, and I aim to promote and foster this mindset wherever I find myself working 🩷
