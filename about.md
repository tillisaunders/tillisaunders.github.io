# About Me
Hi, I'm Tilli 👋 I'm a Level Designer currently working in the Mobile and F2P sector, based in London.
<br>
I love all types of games, but have a special fondness for RPG games (big fan of Fallout, Elder Scrolls and Baldur's Gate!!)
<br>
<br>
In my free time I also enjoy reading, my favourite genres are Horror/Thriller, Sci-Fi and Fantasy.
